# e6dl-rs

This is [e6dl](https://github.com/tjhorner/e6dl) ported to Rust, which was actually originally [ported from JS](https://github.com/tjhorner/e621-id-downloader). I am not Good At The Rust™️ yet, so I am using this project to get Good At The Rust™️. (i.e., the code is probably bad and not idiomatic).
